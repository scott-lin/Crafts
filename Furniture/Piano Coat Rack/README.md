# Piano Coat Rack

An array of "keys" pivot on a dowel to allow items to be hung on the jutting out key.

The keys can either be aligned perfectly in a row or offset vertically from each other. The latter may give more character to the design, however, not all keys are functional; only some of the keys are functional because keys offset from the ideal pivot height would hit the wall when tilted, thus blocking the pivot motion.

In the 3D model here of the offset design, the highest keys are at the ideal pivot point and would be functional.
